# Space-tech-for-earth
This challenge envisions Tunisia in 2056, where we aim to explore new frontiers in addressing global challenges through the SpaceTech for Earth initiative. In this project, we focus on detecting and predicting natural disasters, proposing advanced solutions to enhance early warning systems and mitigate the impact of these events.
